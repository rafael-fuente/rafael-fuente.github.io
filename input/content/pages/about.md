Hi! I’m Rafael, a physics student interested in how simulations can help to visualize advanced scientific concepts.<br/>
I post in this blog all kinds of physics simulations that I think are worth sharing so I can help others make their own and better understand the science involved.

All simulations can be found in my [GitHub](https://github.com/rafael-fuente).<br/>
The main programming language that I use is Python but I'm also proficient in C++.<br/>
If you don’t understand something and/or have any questions don’t hesitate to ask me about it!
