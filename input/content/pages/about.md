Hi! I'm a graduate Physics student interested in Computational Physics.<br/>
I post in this blog all kind of notes and explanations about my simulations that I think are worth to share, so I can help others make their own and better understand the science involved. 

All simulations can be found in my [github repository](https://github.com/rafael-fuente).<br/>
The main programming language that I use is Python but I'm also proficient in C++.<br/>
I you don't understand something and/or have any question don't hesitate to ask me about it!
